# Movie Scheduling Problem

### Problem Statement
Consider the following scheduling problem. Imagine you are a highly-in- demand actor, who has been presented with offers to star in n different movie projects under development. Each offer comes specified with the first and last day of filming. To take the job, you must commit to being available throughout this entire period. Thus you cannot simultaneously accept two jobs whose intervals overlap.
For an artist such as yourself, the criteria for job acceptance is clear: you want to make as much money as possible. Because each of these films pays the same fee per film, this implies you seek the largest possible set of jobs (intervals) such that no two of them conflict with each other.

#### Input: 
A set `I` of n intervals on the line.

#### Output: 
What is the largest subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals which can be selected from `I`?
